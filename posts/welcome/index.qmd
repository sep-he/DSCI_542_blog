## Why would someone decide to leave a stable job and start learning data science?

This is a question I wrestled with for months, and to be honest, I am still not sure that I have the “right” answer. 
Today, buzzwords like data, AI, and machine learning dominate conversations everywhere, and it seems like everyone wants to learn data skills and “break into tech”. 
My name is Sepehr, and I am a former quality analyst who decided to go back to school to pursue a master’s degree in data science. 

In this blog, I will share why I made this decision, the challenges I have faced, and the lessons I have learned. 
This article may help your decision to change career paths or reaffirm that you are right where you need to be. 
If you decide to follow my path, I will share some tips that might just be helpful.

## My Starting Point

One important note is that I do not come from a computer science or statistical background. 
I graduated with a Bachelor of Science a few years ago and entered the workforce. 
I started as a laboratory analyst and, after a series of promotions, achieved the position I had aimed for since joining the company: quality analyst. 
This was my biggest professional achievement, and I was delighted. 

As a quality analyst, much of my work involved writing reports on operational performance and submitting them to executive managers at the end of each month. 
I also followed up with various teams to ensure that issues were resolved and corrective actions were implemented. 
The role was demanding — there was no room for error, and deadlines were strict — but I enjoyed the challenge because I could see the positive impact of my work on the company’s operations. 
Additionally, I enjoyed working on a new problem every day rather than doing the same task in a routine.

## My Decision

Over time, however, I realized that while my work influenced decision-making at the operational level, 
the company’s most significant decisions—the ones that shaped its strategy and allocated resources—were driven by the insights of data scientists. 
It was their ability to harness data and drive strategic change that inspired me.  

This realization sparked my desire for change. 
I wanted to contribute to decision-making on a larger scale and make a broader impact. 
I was inspired by this skillset, where one can confidently perform a series of operations on collected data to make decision-making more robust and efficient.

## What is Data Science?

Initially, I thought that data science was another term for computer science. 
I imagined that data scientists spent their days writing long code scripts. 
I quickly learned that it was much more than that.

Data science is the study of processing and utilizing data to make data-driven decisions. 
This skill is one of the most useful tools organizations use to improve operations and achieve their goals. 
Data scientists use tools like Python, R, or other programming languages to clean and manage data. 
This may include removing redundant points in the data, filling in missing values, or performing mathematical operations on data points to make them more interpretable.

They also perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), meaning they create graphs, charts, 
or statistical summaries to understand the relationships and patterns between the points in the data frame. 
Ultimately, they leverage this to build machine learning models, which are systems that learn from data to make predictions or identify trends, providing actionable insights.

## My Experience

Once I decided to pursue this path and leave my job, I was excited but unsure if it was the right move. 
I expected the biggest challenge to be mastering the technical skills I needed to succeed in data science, 
such as coding in Python, R, machine learning, and statistical analysis.  

In reality, this journey was even more challenging than I had anticipated. 
There were numerous technical skills to learn, from using the [Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/) in Python to manage DataFrames, 
to learning Structured Query Language (SQL) for obtaining data from databases.
 While these skills are fundamental for any data scientist, 
 I realized that they are not the main reason data scientists are valued in organizations.

Soft skills, I discovered, are just as important, if not more so, than technical skills. 
Communicating findings effectively, collaborating in teams, and tailoring presentations to different audiences are crucial for success. 
I was surprised by how much emphasis was on these skills in my master’s program. 
Ultimately, my inspiration to learn data science—the ability to harness the power of data to make decision-making more robust and efficient—relies heavily on these soft skills.

## What I Learned

Throughout my journey, I have learned a combination of technical and soft skills that I find are crucial in data science. 
While technical skills are the foundation, it is the soft skills that bring everything together and make the work impactful.

### **Technical Skills**  
- **Python**: Ideal for data cleaning, manipulation, and machine learning.  
- **R**: Useful for statistical analysis and visualization.  
- **SQL**: Essential for retrieving data from databases.  
- **Git and [GitHub](https://github.com/)**: Tools for version control, collaboration, and project organization.  

### **Soft Skills**  
- **Data Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs using tools such as [Altair](https://pypi.org/project/altair/) and [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html).  
- **Communication**: Documenting work, writing reports, and tailoring presentations to different audiences.  
- **Collaboration**: Using GitHub for team projects, sharing work transparently, and reviewing contributions.

## Tips

If you are interested in pursuing data science, here are some tools and skills I recommend focusing on at the beginning of your journey:  

- Basic fundamentals of coding in Python and R.  
- The basics of calculus and linear algebra.  
- Hypothesis testing and statistical inference.  
- Git and GitHub.  
- Data Visualization: Making and interpreting charts, graphs, and tables.

## Conclusion

If by now it’s not clear, I decided to change career paths because I believe in data-driven decision-making. 
I want to be able to use insights from data to help organizations make decisions that will impact the world in a positive way. 
Studying data science has enabled me to get closer to this goal, 
and I hope my story inspires you to consider the opportunities this field can offer for your professional career.
